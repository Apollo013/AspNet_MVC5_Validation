#### REMOTE VALIDATION
This example uses the Remote' attribute to check if an email already exists. A list of pre-defined emails has been specified, so using either "Henry@gmail.com", "Mary@gmail.com", "Philip@gmail.com" or "John@gmail.com" will display an error.

Navigate to 'http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT_HERE]/User/Register', and enter a name and one of the above emails.
